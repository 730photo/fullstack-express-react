Create a fullstack app with one simple terminal command!! 

This script builds out a basic Express sever with an endpoint at /api and a connected React client all from one terminal command 

Name the project whatever you would like, this script takes one argument and that is your project name. If you do not include a project name the command will exit and ask you for a project name.

Secondly this script will create and initialize the app on your home directory. If you would like to change this, find the second command in the script `cd ~/` and put whatever file path you would like. 

Thirdly this script does require you to have a few things already set up locally. 
1. Mongo Installed 
2. Create React App Installed
3. Your Heroku set up on your local machine 
4. NPM Installed 

To run this script fork and clone the repo to your machine. 

CD into the repo 

```cd fullstack-express-react```

CD into bin 

```cd bin```

Then give your self execute permissions. 

```chomd 755 express.sh```

Then you will be ready to go!

Run `./express.sh APPNAME` to create your full stak MERN app deployed to heroku!

APPNAME is where you will name your project. 

Hope yall have fun!
